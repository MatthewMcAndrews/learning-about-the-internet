Learning About the Internet

I am starting to go through the https://developer.mozilla.org and https://my-learning.w3schools.com tutorials for html, css, and javascript.

At work, they are talking about having our team convert some of our desktop applications into web applications. I want to be involved in that transition because, like the sages of the 1970s, I believe the internet is the future.

As I learn new things, I intend to publish the artifacts to https://matthewmcandrews.com

My goal is to publish a CRUD web application with a DB, and a UI displaying data in a grid.
